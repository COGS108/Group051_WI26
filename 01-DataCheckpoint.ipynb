    "“How well does performance on a Dance Dance Revolution chart with difficulty X, defined by the game’s numeric rating, predict a player’s overall skill level across songs of varying difficulty?”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this idea, we aim to address the new player approach to finding a difficulty range. For our rhythm game of interest, we will choose Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), a classic rhythm game. Starting out, it may feel like the game is too easy or too hard. Given pre-existing game stats, we will analyze the data given by a player to make a prediction of their current skill range, or what difficulty X number a player can attempt on average. Furthermore, with this prediction, we can go further into recommending new songs for a player to try out relative to their corresponding difficulty X.\n"

    "As members of the Dance and Rhythm Game Club, we stand to address socioeconomic factors by making arcade rhythm games accessible. We understand the constraints of accessibility to an arcade, time, and disposable income play in being able to experience arcade rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) . It is one of our motivations to implore the general public to try DDR as we bring the arcade experience to campus. As we seek to expand our community, one of the problems we face when reaching out to new players is the willingness to try the game i.e not knowing where to begin. We run into phrases such as “I’m not good”, “I’ve never played before”, and even “I don’t even know where to start!” constantly. To that, we want to devise a method that involves a beginner friendly approach; easing players into DDR assuming they have no experience but an eagerness to learn. For the project, we used three sources based on their relevance to predictive analysis to form the foundation of our research.\n",
    "\n",
    " The paper, “Dance Dance Convolution,” [3](#ref3) is a study that attempts to generate DDR step charts based on machine learning, with two inputs - an audio file, and a desired difficulty. The model would then generate a fully playable chart by decomposing the task into two sequential prediction problems: first determining when steps should occur, and then determining which arrows should be placed at each predicted timing. The results were analyzed based on how similar they were to the original chart - things like average hold note length, arrow selection, and beat placement. The important conclusions that come from the study was the capacity to assign chart difficulty ratings for procedurally generated charts based on note densities, although limited to a max bpm of 120; expanded on in a revisit in 2025 [1](#ref1) which includes a refined version exceeding the 120 bpm threshold. Another useful prediction scheme was being able to predict the chart difficulty [2](#ref2) based on attributes we have assigned as step data and technique data. \n",
    "The main takeaway from the results of the paper, for our uses, is the conclusion that DDR charting aligns closely with underlying musical structure, and that difficulty can be linearly correlated with step frequency, rhythmic density, and other computationally extractable metrics. This is useful for our predictive modeling because it suggests that the player performance data we gather, such as timing accuracy, hit‑window distribution, and error frequency can also be correlated with chart difficulty in a uniform way. Thus, the same mathematical relationships that allow systems like DDC to infer difficulty from audio and chart context can be inverted in our analysis - we can infer a player's effective skill level by measuring how their accuracy degrades or holds steady across segments of varying structural difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “Dance Dance ConvLSTM” [1](#ref1) paper is an extension of this paper, diving deeper into subsections of charting in order to further quantify patterns that arise in step charting - correlated to chart triggers such as music speedups, slowdowns, or certain step patterns, such as repeated notes on the same arrow - these are usually considered to be more difficult to execute than standard patterning. [2](#ref2) This provides a further foundation for our analysis: if machine‑learning models can reliably infer difficulty from musical and structural cues, then player‑performance data should likewise reflect predictable responses to those same cues, enabling skill prediction through our structural‑difficulty analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third paper, “Predicting Chart Difficulty in Rhythm Games Through Classification Using Chart Pattern Derived Attributes,” also deals with the subject of correlating the in-game difficulty numbers with actual difficulty. Their analysis deals with difficulty and correlating it with chart structure - The main conclusions from the paper, useful for our purposes, is that objective structural difficulty can be quantified and measured, and that the charting in the game’s maps is correlated with this difficulty. [3](#ref3) This is useful for us because it means that we can apply a similar analysis to player skill, since performance data (such as timing accuracy, error rate, and stamina degradation, etc.) should correlate with these same difficulty signifiers in the charts. Essentially, If difficulty can be reliably inferred from chart patterns, then player capability can be inferred from how well a player handles those patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the articles and our own playing experience, we found 3 distinct data categories relevant to our project:\n",
    "1. Song Data (exact song) - data showing the title, artist, and folder the song is located in. This is important because there are versions of DDR that run on a different difficulty scale; making sure the songs user play are in the arcade version of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Chart Data (Difficulty X) - The degree of gameplay a player can encounter during a song. Individual songs in DDR can be played on varying difficulty levels. Each difficulty iteration is commonly referred to as a chart. Charts are given numerical values assigned by DDR from 1-20 (we will assign this number to X). As the number increases, players can expect an increase of notes on the screen (note density) and rhythmic patterns. Charts of equal value have the tendency to feature similar complexity. For example, Song A with difficulty 5 will be as equal as Song B with difficulty 5 in terms of chart complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Performance data (how a player does) - the overall score an individual obtains along with a timeline of where the player missed notes. This works in tandem with step data and technique data to evaluate what core fundamentals the person has/needs improvement on. In our project, we will use some of DDR's iconic scoring systems to assess new players (more info in HYPOTHESIS)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these articles make great strides in the development of generated difficulty, we find the limitation of these contexts to engage with the new player community and the base game of DDR. Having the opportunity to expand on these works, we want to take chart predictions and the data acquired to contextualize them for the use of a new player; giving them a direction as they start their rhythm game journey.\n",

    "As players take on higher difficulty X ratings, DDR charts demand greater stamina, precision, and pattern recognition due to chart complexity increasing (i.e total stepcount, rhythms implemented, how many notes appear at once). Therefore, players who achieve EX% around the community avg EX% reflect the capacity to comprehend and execute these factors. We come to this conclusion since chart complexity can be generalized across songs of equal difficulty X rating; reflecting their underlying skill. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We predict a strong correlation between a player's EX% reflecting their overall skill level when compared to the avg EX%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the skill of a player, we have used/adjusted preexisting variables DDR currently implements to assess players:\n",
    "1. Difficulty X - As stated previously, DDR difficulty has a rating numbered from easiest to hardest: 1-20. DDR includes 4 standard labels: BEGINNER 1-4 , BASIC 3-7, DIFFICULT 5-9, EXPERT 10-13+. One issue that has arisen was the overlapping ranges in the standard labels. As an example, one song can have a BASIC 7, while another song can have a DIFFICULT 7 even though there is no major difficulty spike between the two. For a new player, seeing DIFFICULT 7 instead of BASIC 7 may afflict a bias when choosing the difficulty. To avoid ambiguity, we want to simplify the system purely on the numeric RATING; assigning it to our variable, X (X can range from 1-20). When we refer to difficulty X now, it provides a clearer representation of difficulty while still utilizing the pre-existing DDR system. (a 7 is a 7!).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. EX - EX is a scoring system originating from DDR EXTREME; independent from the in game combo and life bar players use. EX was designed to be a timing-based accuracy score, given by the summation of the 2 best timing judgements - Marvelous and Perfect. To calculate EX, the formula is given below:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        EX = ∑ 2(Marvelous) + 1(Perfect)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. EX% - EX% is EX normalized. Because charts have varying total notecounts EX alone is\n",
    "Not enough to determine overall skill level. By normalizing EX, we obtain a metric that allows us to compare charts of different total notecounts. To calculate EX% we use the formula:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        EX% = EX/(3 x Total Notecount)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. median EX% (med EX%)  - The median EX% on a given song that will give us the baseline for a player's performance in relation to players who also attempted  chart difficulty X. We understand that one of the constraints of community-driven data is the possibility of inflated averages due to the data coming from registered users. These registered users offer a higher level of time commitment and scoring data than our new player demographic. For our project Median EX% is used to operationalize target performance that a player must achieve to be considered for that difficulty X skill level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Overall skill level - A player's overall skill level is operationalized as their individual EX% on a difficulty X chart in relation to the given difficulty X’s median EX%. This is best represented by the difficulty X they can reliably play.\n",

Song titles in this dataset are labeled by their presence in the DDR scene - giving us an indicator if a song is available in an arcade version of DDR.

    "Animefest Player Scores is our first attempt to apply our model to a sample of new players during UCSD Animefest 2026. Our start time was 12:00pm and ended around 7:30pm. To take the data we used an online program of DDR called “Simply Love (v.5.1)” to mimic the arcade experience. From this data, the most relevant variables are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Song_dir - What song they played\n",
    "\n",
    "difficulty - uses their beginner/basic/difficult/expert labels\n",

    "The big concern during animefest was that we anticipated most people would like to play “anime” songs. Anime songs are usually custom charted and do not reflect chart complexity for standard DDR charts. Because we prioritize the well-being of our community, we would not interfere with song selection, but came to terms with the amount of valid data provided being significantly less than reported.\n"

The purpose of this dataset is to provide the us with a song encyclopedia devoid of songs outside the arcade version of DDR along with any other exclusives not accessible to new players. This will have the song TITLE of only (AC)(INTL) songs along with their corresponding DIFFICULTY X, Max EX%, median EX%, and amount of times the song was played. This dataset will be a unified dataset titled “DDR song Difficulty and Average Performance”. With this encyclopedia built we can make another unified data set that combines “DDR song Difficulty and Average Performance” to the “Animefest Player Scores”; assessing each player.\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "    We will be collecting data from AnimeFest, on February 14th using a DDR pad provided by the DRGC club on campus. We will brief attendees of our project, how their data is used, and that it is completely optional. We won’t be collecting signatures as it is already made anonymous by the software.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "    One form of collection bias we will encounter is the population we are sampling at AnimeFest. The majority of participants will most likely be UCSD students. Furthermore, we will be sampling from a small subset of UCSD students, those who are attending AnimeFest. However, we believe this bias will be negligible due to our other datasets being of varying age groups. Also, our goal is to collect a sample size of fifty to normalize the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "     PII will be minimized at AnimeFest since the software ensures anonymity.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Addressed downstream bias in constraint and limitations of community-driven averages (how we got avg EX%) and how this may be an unfair comparison.  At animefest, we tried to keep players on the same settings so we can evaluate them equally, but this also opens the constraint of players having different preferences when playing rhythm games. When evaluating player performance, we must reason with if their score is in the scope of the avg EX%. One way we devised was calculating the IQR across difficulty X’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "       \n",
    "    No, one of our references is a “living” document of all player data and serves as a valuable resource to the rhythm game community.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relevant stakeholders include the high level/ optimization level players that are also accounted for in our dataset. This is something to be conscious about when looking at the scores relative to a predicted score of a new player. We have established a target demographic as the subject of interest in our rhythm game community. One other lingering concern would be DDR quality across all players. Some places do not take good care of their DDR machines and this leads to game impact (low sensitivity = losing score) and we acknowledge how this may affect averages.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    One possible bias that we encounter will be in our dataset that takes in registered users. A possibility is that with a highly-motivated player base like DDR, there will be players who work on optimization of their scores and might play lower level difficulties for accuracy; these players will bring the average score up. This bias is mitigated by the large sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Yes. All player data involved in calculations are stripped independently from the individual who produced them and the players remain anonymous. At most, there is a tie to their in-game username, but that can be excluded as well.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "     One of our resources is part of a living document that dates back almost 3 years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Our dataset does not include protected attributes such as race, gender, or age, so inherently our analysis cannot discriminate upon these characteristics. To avoid proxy discrimination we use DDR’s performance-based metrics that treats an individual as equal among other players such as difficulty X, EX, EX% and avg EX%.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "    For metrics we have developed 4 categories of data collection that all work in tandem with each other.\n",
    "       \n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "     We have communicated that our purpose is to appeal to the beginner/casual approach to starting rhythm games and the model will serve as a way to accommodate these members of our rhythm game community. Knowledge acquired through this data science may not serve a higher skill level, rather help reach out to those trying to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Our model is designed to help new DDR players understand difficulty ranges through the numeric rating, but we understand using data geared toward the DDR community can result in skewed data that represents the competitive DDR scene via registered users. However, as a community that strives for improvement, these players unintentionally set a bar for players coming in; a bar that appears daunting at first. We will try our best to still represent our target demographic of new players while acknowledging long-time players."
